📌 Bitcoin Deposit System Proposal

We want to implement a secure and automated Bitcoin deposit system for our platform. The goal is to replace the current manual approval process with a fully automated, blockchain-verified workflow.

🔹 1. User Account Creation
	•	When a user creates an account, the system automatically generates a unique Bitcoin address assigned only to that user.
	•	This address remains tied to the user for all deposits.

🔹 2. Deposit Initialization
	•	When a user taps the Deposit Page, they are first asked to input the amount they want to deposit.
	•	After confirming the amount, the system creates a deposit session for that user.

🔹 3. Deposit Address Display
	•	The deposit page then loads and shows the following:
	•	The user’s assigned Bitcoin deposit address
	•	The deposit amount they must send
	•	A 30-minute countdown timer (validity window for this session)

🔹 4. User Action
	•	The user sends BTC to the deposit address.
	•	After sending, they tap a button labeled “Confirm I’ve Sent It”.

🔹 5. System Verification
	•	Once the button is tapped (or even automatically during the session), the system checks the blockchain to confirm:
	•	That the deposit address has received the specified amount.
	•	That the transaction has at least 1–3 confirmations on the blockchain.

🔹 6. Post-Confirmation Actions
	•	If the transaction is verified:
	1.	The deposit amount is automatically credited to the user’s balance on their dashboard.
	2.	The funds are automatically swept from the deposit address to the platform’s main vault address for safekeeping.
	3.	The system displays a popup or page stating “Payment Successful”.

🔹 7. Timeout Handling
	•	If no payment is detected within 30 minutes, the deposit session expires.
	•	The system marks the session as failed/expired, and the user must create a new deposit attempt.

🔹 8. Benefits of This System
	•	✅ No fake deposits – only on-chain verified transactions are credited.
	•	✅ Fully automated – no manual approval needed.
	•	✅ Secure – funds are swept into the vault address after confirmation.
	•	✅ Transparent – every deposit is tied to a unique user address.
	•	✅ User-friendly – clear steps, countdown timer, and instant success confirmation.

🔹 9. Requirements for Implementation
	•	Blockchain monitoring (via Bitcoin node or third-party API like BlockCypher, Blockstream, or BitGo).
	•	Database structure to store:
	•	User accounts and assigned BTC addresses
	•	Deposit sessions (amount, status, timer, confirmations)
	•	Vault transactions
	•	Frontend flow:
	•	Deposit form (enter amount)
	•	Address + countdown display
	•	Confirm button + success popup
	•	Backend flow:
	•	Generate deposit session
	•	Monitor blockchain
	•	Confirm transactions
	•	Update user balance + sweep to vault

⚡ Instruction for Replit AI Agent:
Please generate the backend logic, database schema, blockchain monitoring, and frontend UI for this deposit flow. Ensure that the system is secure, automated, and scalable.

This way, the proposal covers everything from account creation → deposit session → blockchain verification → balance update → vault transfer → timeout handling.
