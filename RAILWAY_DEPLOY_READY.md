# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Ready âœ…

Your project is now fully configured for Railway deployment!

## What's Been Configured

âœ… **Database**: Switched from Neon to standard PostgreSQL  
âœ… **Server**: Properly binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses `PORT` environment variable  
âœ… **CORS**: Updated to allow Railway domains (`*.railway.app`)  
âœ… **Build**: Production build works perfectly (583KB frontend, 116KB backend)  
âœ… **Railway Config**: `railway.json` with NIXPACKS configuration  
âœ… **Nixpacks**: `nixpacks.toml` configured for Node.js 20.x  
âœ… **Ignore File**: `.railwayignore` excludes development files
